## Validation Notes

### LangChain Versioning Strategy
- All LangChain packages share the same **major.minor** (0.3) for compatibility
- **Patch** versions vary as each package releases independently
- This ensures ecosystem compatibility while allowing independent updates

### FastMCP Evolution
- FastMCP 1.0 was incorporated into the official MCP SDK
- FastMCP 2.0+ (current) provides enhanced features beyond the core protocol
- Version 2.8.0 is the latest stable release

### Redis Integration
- `redis[hiredis]` includes the high-performance hiredis parser
- Version 6.2.0 is the current stable release
- `langchain-redis` 0.2.2 is the official partner package

## Application Status

✅ **All dependencies successfully installed and validated**
✅ **Application starts without import errors**
✅ **All RAG chains initialize successfully**
✅ **FastAPI server runs on http://0.0.0.0:8000**

## Next Steps

1. **Redis MCP Integration**: Test Redis caching functionality
2. **MCP Server**: Verify FastMCP.from_fastapi() conversion
3. **Performance Testing**: Validate caching performance improvements
4. **Documentation**: Update API documentation with current versions
