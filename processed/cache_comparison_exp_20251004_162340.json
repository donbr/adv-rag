      "response": "The general opinion about the John Wick series appears mixed based on the context provided. The first John Wick movie received very positive reviews, with comments praising its stylish action, simple but effective plot, and Keanu Reeves' performance. For example, one review gave it a 10/10 rating and called it a must-see for action fans, highlighting the smooth and fun action sequences. Another review rated it 8/10 and appreciated its kinetic and stylish action.\n\nHowever, later movies such as John Wick 3 and John Wick 4 received more negative feedback. One review of John Wick 3 gave it a 1/10 rating, criticizing it as mindless, plotless, and overly violent. Another review of John Wick 4 rated it only 4/10, calling it the weakest of the series with little meaningful plot and excessive inconsequential violence.\n\nIn summary, while the original John Wick was generally liked and praised, the later installments seem to have garnered a more divided or negative reception.",
