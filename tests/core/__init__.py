"""
Core component unit tests for the Advanced RAG project.

This package contains unit tests for the core infrastructure components:
- test_settings.py - Configuration management validation
- test_logging_config.py - Logging system testing  
- test_exceptions.py - Exception hierarchy validation

These tests ensure that the shared infrastructure components work correctly
in isolation before being integrated into the larger RAG and MCP systems.
All tests use pytest and follow testing best practices with fixtures,
parameterization, and comprehensive coverage.

Test Coverage: 57 tests covering settings, logging, and exception handling.
