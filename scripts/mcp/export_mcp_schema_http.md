# HTTP MCP Schema Export Update Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the step-by-step approach for updating `export_mcp_schema_http.py` to work with streamable-HTTP transport instead of local MCP object imports. This migration enables production-ready schema export with improved CI/CD integration and standards compliance.

## Current State vs Target State

### Current (STDIO Mode)
```python
from src.mcp_server.fastapi_wrapper import mcp
async with Client(mcp) as client:
    tools = await client.list_tools()
```

### Target (HTTP Mode)  
```python
HTTP_SERVER_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:8001/mcp"
async with Client(HTTP_SERVER_URL, transport="streamable-http") as client:
    openrpc_schema = await client.discover()  # Native discovery
```

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Analyze Current Dependencies

**Before making changes, document current state:**
- `export_mcp_schema_http.py` imports `from src.mcp_server.fastapi_wrapper import mcp`
- Uses `async with Client(mcp) as client:` for local object connection
- Has functions: `export_mcp_definitions()`, `export_mcp_definitions_official()`
- Configuration file: `mcp_config_http.toml`
- Server running: `fastmcp run src/mcp_server/fastapi_wrapper.py --transport streamable-http --port 8001`

**Reference Validation**: *Issue #600* clarifies that "The MCP specification can be found in the schema folder" and supports different transport mechanisms, validating our stdio‚ÜíHTTP migration approach.

### Step 2: Modify Import Statements

**Remove local MCP import:**
```python
# REMOVE this line
# from src.mcp_server.fastapi_wrapper import mcp
```

**Add HTTP-specific dependencies:**
```python
import httpx  # For server health checks
from fastmcp import Client  # Keep this
from src.main_api import app as fastapi_app  # Still needed for FastAPI metadata
```

**Reference**: *PR #1998 (SchemaFlow SSE Implementation)* demonstrates HTTP-based transport patterns, showing that MCP servers can effectively use web-based transports instead of stdio for production deployments.

### Step 3: Add Server Configuration and Verification

**Add configuration constant:**
```python
# HTTP server configuration
HTTP_SERVER_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:8001/mcp"
```

**Add server verification function:**
```python
async def verify_server_running():
    """Verify MCP server is running before attempting schema export."""
    try:
        async with httpx.AsyncClient(timeout=5.0) as client:
            response = await client.post(
                HTTP_SERVER_URL,
                json={"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "ping", "params": {}}
            )
            if response.status_code == 200:
                logger.info(f"‚úÖ MCP server is running at {HTTP_SERVER_URL}")
                return True
            else:
                logger.error(f"‚ùå Server returned status {response.status_code}")
                return False
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"‚ùå Cannot connect to MCP server at {HTTP_SERVER_URL}: {e}")
                 logger.error("üí° Make sure the server is running with: fastmcp run src/mcp_server/fastapi_wrapper.py --transport streamable-http --port 8001")
         return False
```

**Reference**: *PR #640 (Web Discovery Extension)* demonstrates HTTP-based discovery patterns and emphasizes the need for proper server verification, as "Public LLMs and agents cannot automatically locate MCP endpoints" without standardized HTTP discovery mechanisms.

### Step 4: Update Client Connection Methods

**Modify all export functions to use HTTP connections:**

```python
async def export_mcp_definitions():
    """Export MCP server definitions as JSON (HTTP mode - legacy format)."""
    
    # Verify server is running first
    if not await verify_server_running():
        raise ConnectionError("MCP server is not accessible")
    
    async with Client(HTTP_SERVER_URL, transport="streamable-http") as client:
        # Get all definitions via HTTP
        tools = await client.list_tools()
        resources = await client.list_resources()
        prompts = await client.list_prompts()
        # ... rest of function
```

**Apply same pattern to:**
- `export_mcp_definitions_official()`

**Reference**: *LangChain MCP Adapters PR #140* shows "streamable-http-stateless" implementations, demonstrating that HTTP clients can be stateless and connection-independent, making them more reliable than stdio for automated environments.

### Step 5: Add Native Discovery Method (RECOMMENDED)

**Create new function using FastMCP's native discovery:**
```python
async def export_mcp_definitions_native():
    """Export MCP server definitions using native discovery (HTTP mode)."""
    
    # Verify server is running first
    if not await verify_server_running():
        raise ConnectionError("MCP server is not accessible")
    
    async with Client(HTTP_SERVER_URL, transport="streamable-http") as client:
        # Use native MCP discovery - returns complete OpenRPC document
        logger.info("üîç Using native MCP discovery via HTTP...")
        openrpc_schema = await client.discover()
        
        # The discover() method returns the complete OpenRPC specification
        # This is the official MCP schema format
        return openrpc_schema
```

**Benefits of Native Discovery:**
- ‚úÖ Uses official MCP `rpc.discover` method
- ‚úÖ Returns complete OpenRPC specification
- ‚úÖ Standards compliant
- ‚úÖ CI/CD friendly
- ‚úÖ Works with curl and standard HTTP tools

**Reference**: *Issue #673* specifically requests "a simplified document that contains all and only the specification documents themselves" and mentions tooling for "validation of an implementation or SDK against the spec." The native `client.discover()` method directly addresses this need by providing "a single document that a user, or an LLM, can refer to and read the entire protocol specification."

### Step 6: Update Main Function and File Outputs

**Modify main() to support multiple export methods:**
```python
async def main():
    """Export and save MCP definitions via HTTP."""
    logger.info("üîÑ Exporting MCP server definitions via HTTP...")
    
    try:
        # OPTION 1: Use native MCP discovery (RECOMMENDED)
        logger.info("üì° Using native MCP discovery...")
        native_schema = await export_mcp_definitions_native()
        
        # OPTION 2: Export community format (legacy)
        community_schema = await export_mcp_definitions()
        
        # OPTION 3: Export official MCP format (manual reconstruction)
        official_schema = await export_mcp_definitions_official()
        
        # Save native discovery format (RECOMMENDED)
        native_file = Path("mcp_server_native.json")
        with open(native_file, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            json.dump(native_schema, f, indent=2, ensure_ascii=False)
        
        # Save community format (legacy)
        community_file = Path("mcp_server_schema_http.json")
        with open(community_file, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            json.dump(community_schema, f, indent=2, ensure_ascii=False)
        
        # Save official format (manual reconstruction)
        official_file = Path("mcp_server_official_http.json")
        with open(official_file, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            json.dump(official_schema, f, indent=2, ensure_ascii=False)
        
        print(f"‚úÖ Exported {len(official_schema['tools'])} tools")
        print(f"üìÑ üéØ Native MCP Discovery (RECOMMENDED): {native_file.absolute()}")
        print(f"üìÑ Legacy/Community format: {community_file.absolute()}")
        print(f"üìÑ Official MCP format (manual): {official_file.absolute()}")
                 print(f"üåê Transport: HTTP ({HTTP_SERVER_URL})")
```

**Reference**: *PR #616 (Tool Annotations Enhancement)* shows the evolution of MCP schemas with "comprehensive ToolAnnotations" for "Governance & Compliance", "Resource Management", and "User Experience." Our HTTP export must preserve these enhanced annotations which are critical for "Organizations implementing MCP [who] need better metadata about tools to support governance policies, security controls, and user experience enhancements."

### Step 7: Testing and Validation Workflow

**Start the HTTP server:**
```bash
fastmcp run src/mcp_server/fastapi_wrapper.py --transport streamable-http --port 8001
```

**Run the export script:**
```bash
python scripts/mcp/export_mcp_schema_http.py
```

**Verify outputs:**
- `mcp_server_native.json` (recommended - uses rpc.discover)
- `mcp_server_schema_http.json` (legacy community format)
- `mcp_server_official_http.json` (manual reconstruction)

**Validate HTTP connectivity:**
```bash
# Test server ping
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8001/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"ping","params":{}}'

# Test native discovery  
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8001/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"rpc.discover","params":{}}'
```

**Reference**: *PR #640 (Web Discovery Extension)* emphasizes HTTP-based discovery patterns and the validation approach: "This has been fully tested locally and publicly. An html file and examples are provided" - demonstrating that HTTP endpoints must be thoroughly testable via standard web tools.

### Step 8: Configuration Updates

**Update `mcp_config_http.toml` for HTTP-specific settings:**
```toml
[server]
# HTTP-specific configuration
base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:8001/mcp"
timeout_seconds = 30
retry_attempts = 3

[http]
# HTTP transport specific settings
verify_ssl = false  # for local development
connection_timeout = 5.0
read_timeout = 30.0

[export]
# Output file naming for HTTP mode
native_file = "mcp_server_native.json"
community_file = "mcp_server_schema_http.json"
official_file = "mcp_server_official_http.json"
```

**Reference**: *PR #1998 (SchemaFlow)* demonstrates production HTTP configuration with "Token-based authentication for secure access" and "Real-time schema caching and updates," showing that HTTP-based MCP servers require proper configuration management for production deployment.

## Migration Strategy

### Concurrent Operation
- Run both stdio and HTTP modes during transition
- Gradual adoption of HTTP-based schema export
- Maintain backward compatibility during migration

### Recommended Migration Path
1. **Phase 1**: Implement HTTP export alongside existing stdio export
2. **Phase 2**: Test HTTP export in development environment  
3. **Phase 3**: Update CI/CD to use HTTP export
4. **Phase 4**: Deprecate stdio export for schema generation
5. **Phase 5**: Full migration to HTTP-based schema workflows

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Server Not Running
**Error**: `Cannot connect to MCP server`  
**Solution**: Ensure server is started with correct port:
```bash
fastmcp run src/mcp_server/fastapi_wrapper.py --transport streamable-http --port 8001
```

### Connection Timeouts
**Error**: `TimeoutError` during schema export  
**Solution**: Increase timeout in configuration or check server performance

### Import Errors
**Error**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src'`  
**Solution**: Run with `PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)` prefix:
```bash
PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) python scripts/mcp/export_mcp_schema_http.py
```

### Schema Validation Failures
**Error**: JSON schema validation errors  
**Solution**: Use native discovery method which returns standards-compliant schemas

## Summary

This HTTP migration transforms the schema export process from a local Python import dependency to a network-accessible, standards-compliant HTTP service. The native discovery method provides the best combination of standards compliance, performance, and CI/CD integration.
