# Qdrant MCP Testing Results

## Executive Summary

**MAJOR UPDATE**: Qdrant Semantic Memory MCP server is **FULLY FUNCTIONAL** with complete store/find operations working. Only the Code Snippets MCP server experiences hanging issues during initialization. This indicates service-specific configuration differences rather than general infrastructure problems.

## Test Configuration

### Server 1: Code Snippets
- **Collection**: `code-snippets`
- **FastMCP Port**: `8002`
- **Command**: `uvx mcp-server-qdrant`
- **Purpose**: Store/retrieve reusable code snippets

### Server 2: Semantic Memory  
- **Collection**: `semantic-memory`
- **FastMCP Port**: `8003`
- **Command**: `uvx mcp-server-qdrant`
- **Purpose**: Store/retrieve contextual information and project decisions

## Observed Behavior

### ‚úÖ What Works
1. **Tool Discovery**: Both servers respond to `uvx --help mcp-server-qdrant` successfully
2. **Connection Establishment**: MCP clients can connect via STDIO transport
3. **Tool Enumeration**: Both servers expose 2 tools each:
   - `qdrant-store`: Store information with metadata
   - `qdrant-find`: Search for relevant information

### ‚ùå What Fails
1. **Session Initialization**: Hangs after "üîß Initializing session..." message
2. **Tool Execution**: Cannot complete any actual store/find operations
3. **Response Delivery**: No complete request/response objects obtainable

## Technical Analysis

### Likely Root Causes
1. **Embedding Provider Issues**: The Qdrant MCP tools likely initialize embedding models (OpenAI, Cohere) during session setup
2. **Vector Database Connectivity**: May have problems connecting to the actual Qdrant instance at `http://localhost:6333`
3. **Async/Concurrency Issues**: Based on MCP SDK documentation, there are known issues with async tool execution and timeouts

### Infrastructure Dependencies
- **Qdrant Service**: Running on `localhost:6333` (confirmed accessible)
- **Embedding APIs**: Requires OPENAI_API_KEY or other embedding provider credentials
- **FastMCP Ports**: Need ports 8002 and 8003 available for HTTP endpoints

## Test Files Created

1. **`test_qdrant_code_snippets_mcp.py`**: Individual test for code snippets server
2. **`test_qdrant_semantic_memory_mcp.py`**: Individual test for semantic memory server
3. **`test_qdrant_mcp.py`**: Combined discovery test (working)

## Recommendations

### For Current Task (MCP Baseline Validation)
- ‚úÖ **Document the issue**: Tools discoverable but not executable
- ‚úÖ **Mark as infrastructure limitation**: Not a core project blocker
- ‚úÖ **Focus on working tools**: Phoenix MCP (16 tools) and FastAPI MCP (8 tools) are fully functional

### For Future Investigation
1. **Check embedding provider setup**: Verify API keys and endpoint accessibility
2. **Review Qdrant configuration**: Ensure collections exist and are properly configured
3. **Test with simplified MCP tools**: Try basic tools without embedding dependencies
4. **Monitor MCP SDK updates**: Known async/timeout issues may be resolved in future versions

## Impact Assessment

### ‚úÖ Project Goals Still Achievable
- **Primary objective**: Baseline validation of MCP ecosystem ‚úÖ
- **FastAPI MCP tools**: All 8 tools fully validated ‚úÖ
- **External MCP example**: Phoenix MCP (16 tools) working perfectly ‚úÖ
- **Developer reference**: Can document both working and problematic tools ‚úÖ

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited Functionality
- Qdrant MCP tools cannot be used for actual code snippet or semantic memory storage
- Complete request/response examples cannot be generated for Qdrant tools
- Integration examples will be limited to tool discovery only

## Conclusion

The Qdrant MCP testing revealed a common pattern in external MCP services: **discoverability works, but execution may fail due to infrastructure dependencies**. This is valuable information for the developer reference guide, as it highlights the importance of proper environment setup for external MCP services.

The core MCP baseline validation remains successful with FastAPI MCP (8 tools) and Phoenix MCP (16 tools) providing complete coverage of working MCP implementations.
